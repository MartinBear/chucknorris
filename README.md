This is why soldiers figth and what make babies smile,
its the Chuck Norris app that generates hilarious jokes on demand.
You can fetch as many jokes as you want to and you can generate a joke with 
your very own name.

# Technologies used:
+ Bootstrap v4
+ JQuery
+ ajax method
+ HTML
+ CSS
+ JavaScript
+ w3c's HTML & CSS validator

# API used

http://www.icndb.com/api/

Fun to use API that can return raw json and jsonp data
and it have a shit ton of jokes in the database.

# The development

At the start of this project I had no clue what api to use. I were searching around on 
the web and found this api. Me and my mates had a HUGH Chuck Norris hype a couple of years ago 
so no questions asked, I had to use this api. The work process were kind of a struggle since I'm still a noob.
I started with some pseudo code and a mind-map. Then I finished up the HTML,JavaScript and JQuery.
Then I revamp the html with Bootstrap and added some CSS.

# TODO's
### Things to make more awesome
+ Share on Facebook or Tweet.
+ Add a picture of Chuck Norris
+ Make the JavaScript less messy
